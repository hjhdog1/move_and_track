<h4><a name="2_SupportedSystems"></a>2 - Supported systems</h4>

<p>The driver installation packages and device firmware updates are available on
our web site and on the Kvaser CD which you got together with the hardware when
you purchased it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><a name="21_Supported_OS"></a>2.1 Supported operating systems</h4>

<p>For a full list of supported operating systems, see

<h4><a name="4_DriverInstallation"></a>4 - Driver installation
</h4>

<p>We recommend that you install the drivers first, and then install the
hardware.
</p>


<p>If you are upgrading the drivers, we recommend that you remove all Kvaser
hardware before installing the update. In that way you can be sure that no
applications are using the hardware and that no files are locked during the
installation. The installation will work just fine even if you don't remove the
hardware, but you might have to reboot before the new drivers are actually used.
</p>

<p>If you are upgrading the drivers, you should under any circumstances <b>close
all applications that use the CAN (or LIN) bus</b> before starting the upgrade.

<a name="41_firsttime"></a>4.1 - First-time driver installation
</h4>

<h5>Windows 8, Windows 7 and Windows Vista</h5>

<ol>
  <li>When you start the installation program, Windows will ask for the password
    of an account with administrative rights, or, if you are already logged into
    an account with such rights, you will be presented with a &quot;consent
    dialog&quot; that asks you for permission to continue.</li>

  <li>Run the installation program. It will copy the driver files to your hard
    disk and register them with Windows.</li>

  <li>The first time you install new Kvaser hardware of a particular type,
    Windows will display the "Found New Hardware Wizard". Since all the required
    driver files are already installed on your computer, all you need to do is
    to click the Next and OK buttons to complete the wizard. Windows will search
    for the driver files and will discover them automatically. You don't need
    the driver CD at this stage.</ol>

<b>Note</b>: Windows will ask you if you want to look on Windows Update for
 updated drivers. We recommend that you answer &quot;No, not this time&quot; -
 it will save you time.</li>


<h5>Windows 2000/XP/2003</h5>

<ol>
  <li>Be sure you are logged into the Administrator account, or another account
    with administrator privileges.</li>

  <li>Run the installation program. It will copy the driver files to your hard
    disk and register them with Windows.</li>

  <li>The first time you install new Kvaser hardware of a particular type,
    Windows will display the "Found New Hardware Wizard". Since all the required
    driver files are already installed on your computer, all you need to do is
    to click the Next and OK buttons to complete the wizard. Windows will search
    for the driver files and will discover them automatically. You don't need
    the driver CD at this stage.</ol>

<b>Note</b>: Windows XP Service Pack 2 (and later) will ask you if you want to
    look on Windows Update for updated drivers. We recommend that you answer
    &quot;No, not this time&quot; - it will save you time.</li>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><a name="42_update"></a>4.2 - Updating an existing driver installation</h4>

<p>If your current driver version is <b>3.4 or later</b> you can simply re-run
the installation program. All Kvaser drivers will be updated.</p>

<p>If your current driver version is older than 3.4, you need to manually
uninstall the drivers, reboot your machine, and then follow the above
instructions for a first-time installation.</p>

<p>To find out which version you are currently using, start Kvaser Hardware from
the Control Panel, and select the "About" tab.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h4><a name="43_remove"></a>4.3 - Removing the drivers</h4>

<p>
To remove the installed drivers, simply uninstall them using the Control Panel&nbsp;
(&quot;Add/Remove software&quot; in Windows XP).
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> If you want to reinstall the drivers, a restart may be needed in
some cases between the uninstallation and the reinstallation. If the
reinstallation fails, try to restart the computer and then run the
installation again.

<a name="61_postinstall"></a>6.1 - Post-installation tasks
</h4>

<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Important</font></b> - after a successful driver
installation, we recommend that you use the <b>Kvaser Hardware</b> application (see
below under Installation verification) to check the firmware revision of the
device. You should then check the Kvaser CD and our web site for firmware
updates. We try to ensure that all devices are shipped with the latest revision
of the firmware, but there might be updates available anyway, especially if you
have purchased the device through one of our qualified resellers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><a name="62_verify"></a>6.2 - Installation verification
</h4>

<p> Working devices should be listed together with a
little green icon under "Can Devices (KVASER)" in the Device Manager.
</p>

<p>In the Control Panel, open the <b>Kvaser Hardware</b> application. The driver is
working and communicating with the device if the firmware revision can be read.
</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: An Ethercan Light device will not be listed in the Device Manager before a connection to the device has been established. 
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
</p>

<h4>
<a name="63_troubleshooting"></a>6.3 - Installation troubleshooting
</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>For USB devices, there's a problem in Windows XP which is described in detail in Microsoft KB article Q314634. Essentially the USB port
has been put to sleep by the OS and will not detect an USB device that is plugged in. If your USB hardware isn't discovered by Windows
XP, go to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com" target="_blank"> support.microsoft.com</a> and search for this KB article.
</p></li>

<li><p>Windows will display the "Found New Hardware Wizard" the first time
you plug in a USB device in a USB port where a device of this type hasn't
been used before. This is a design feature
in Windows.  If the "Found New Hardware Wizard" is displayed, just
click the Next and OK buttons and let Windows search for the drivers.
It will find them automatically.
</p></li>

<li><p>If a device is marked with a yellow question mark in the Device Manager,
try to right click at it and select
Uninstall. Then physically remove the device and reinsert it, or reboot the
computer. The
"Found New Hardware Wizard" should then be displayed. As described
above, just click the Next and OK buttons and let Windows reinstall
the drivers automatically.
</p></li>

<li><p>If the installation still seems to be faulty, check the <b> Control
Panel | Kvaser Hardware | Diagnostics tab</b>. Look for error messages.
(These are clearly labeled as such.)
</p></li>

<li><p>You should also
check the <b> Control Panel | Administrative Tools | Event Log</b>.
Errors from the driver routines are found in the System log.
The Source column tells you which driver produced the error. See the table
of supported hardware in the beginning of this document for a list of the
driver names for Kvaser hardware.
</p></li>

<li><p>Many installation problems are solved by a reboot followed by a
  reinstallation of the driver package.
</p></li>

<li><p>Many of our devices have LEDs that can tell you something about the health of
the device. For example, a Kvaser Leaf or PCIcan II that flashes quickly (around
one flash per second) with the green LED typically has a firmware configuration
problem. The LED flashing is described in detail in the hardware manual of the
device in question.
</p></li>

<li><p>There are a number of scripts installed together with the drivers that
  can be useful when solving some more awkward problems. Go to the directory
  where you installed the drivers (typically c:\Program Files\Kvaser\Drivers)
  and read the file 00readme-scripts.txt.

<p>&nbsp;
</p>

<h4>
<a name="71_vector"></a>7.1 - Driver compatibility with products from Vector Informatik, GmbH
</h4>

<p>
Starting with CANLIB 3.4, our drivers are fully compatible with CANalyzer, CANoe and other products from Vector Informatik, Germany.
You will need at least version 4.1 plus service packs of CANalyzer/CANoe.
</p>

<p>
You can install CANLIB 3.4 or later on a machine that has CAN hardware from Vector (e.g. CANcardX,
CANcardXL) installed already; no
conflicts will arise, no files are replaced, and the interfaces will happily work in parallel.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
</p>


<h4><a name="73_silentmode"></a>7.2 - Running the installation in silent mode
</h4>

<p>You can run the installation packages in silent mode, meaning that no user
interaction is required. (Please note that user action still is needed when
inserting the hardware). To do this, use the <b>/S</b> switch when starting the
installation, e.g.
</p>

<p>kvaser_drivers_setup.exe /S
</p>

<p> The installer may exit with an exit code:

<table border="0" bgcolor="#FFFFCC" cellpadding="2">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Code</b></td>
    <td><b>Meaning</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>Normal execution (no error)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Installation aborted by user (cancel button)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Installation aborted by script
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>100</td>
    <td>The virtual CAN driver, and/or the network enumerator driver, failed to
      start. You should restart the computer and run the installation again.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: You will still get popup messages <b>from Windows</b> when the
drivers are installed. This is by design - newer versions of Windows warn the
user that privileged code is about to be installed. To avoid this you can do
either of:
<ul>
<li>Install Kvaser's certificate in the machine's Trusted Publisher store.</li>
<li>Deploy Kvaser's certificate automatically in a Windows domain using a GPO.</li>
<li>Click the <i>Always trust software from Kvaser AB</i> button.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>
These three things will give the same result, namely the installation
of Kvaser's certificate in the Trusted Publisher store. The popup
message will then not be showed.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;
</p>

<h4><a name="74_codesigning"></a>7.4 - Code signing
</h4>

<p>Starting with CANLIB 4.0, all drivers and other executable files are
digitally signed by Kvaser using an Authenticode&trade; certificate. This certificate
is recognized by Windows Server 2003, Windows XP x64, Windows Vista, and later
versions of Windows. It is ignored by older Windows versions, including Windows
XP and Windows 2000.

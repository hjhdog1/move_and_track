                              CANLIB.DLL
                              ==========

This directory contains a CANLIB.DLL which can be used for PCcan together
with Windows 3.1x.

The other CANLIB.DLL distributed with CANLIB SDK will not load under
Windows 3.x; it can be used only under Windows 95.

The "externally visible" difference between the two CANLIB.DLL files is
that the one for Windows 3.x is slightly larger than the one for Windows 95,
and both DLLs have clear version resources (visible in Windows 95 Explorer.)

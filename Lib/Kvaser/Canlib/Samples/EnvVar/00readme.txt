CANLIB Sample Program : envvar.exe
===================================

This is a 32-bit Windows console mode program that demonstrates how to use environment
variables to communicate with a t script running in a Kvaser Eagle.

You need to compile the t script first, using the command-line compiler
scc.exe. See build.bat.

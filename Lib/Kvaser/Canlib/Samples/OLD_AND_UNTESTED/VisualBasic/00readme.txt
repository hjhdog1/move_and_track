This is a very simple demonstration program which shows how to call
CANLIB32 from Visual Basic 6 (32-bit programs).


Usage
=====
Run two instances of the program. Open channel 0 with one instance and
channel 1 with the other. Send from one program and receive in the
other.


Important Notice
================
You have to connect both channels with a *teminated* loopback cable.


VB4 Users Note
==============
You can also use CANLIB32 from a VB4 (32-bit!) program, but this sample 
program will not load directly into the VB4 IDE as the file formats are
not fully compatible. The program code found in form1.frm should be usable
right away, however, and you can use a text editor to cut-and-paste the code
to a VB4 project.

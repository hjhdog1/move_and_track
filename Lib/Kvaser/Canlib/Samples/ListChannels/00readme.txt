This program, written in Borland Delphi,
lists all CAN channels in the system and displays some
of their properties.

Double-lick on a channel in the list to see more information.

Note that the list is refreshed when a WM_DEVICECHANGE message
is received from Windows. You can use the same technique in your own
programs to detect new or removed CAN hardware.

CANLIB Sample Program : candb_sample.exe
========================================

This is a 32-bit Windows console mode program that uses CANDB to
create and access CAN databases. It creates a database file named
'temp.dlc' in the directory where it is invoked.

The program is just intended as an example of how to use CANDB. It's not
performance optimized in any way. It may, or may not, be useful
for you.

The program is written in C and has been tested with Microsoft compilers.

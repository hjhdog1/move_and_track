CANLIB Sample Program : kvrConnect.exe
=====================================

This is a 32-bit Windows console mode program that sets up a number of 
WLAN devices for future CANLIB use. The program requires the dll and 
dtd files located in the bin directory of canlib SDK.

The program is just intended as an example of how to use KVRLIB. It's not
performance optimized in any way. It may, or may not, be useful for you.

The program is written in C and has been tested with Borland and
Microsoft compilers.

Type 'kvrConnect.exe pwd' to connect to any device with 'pwd' as
accesibility password.

Note that the dummy password 'Hello World' will be used, if the
password is omitted.

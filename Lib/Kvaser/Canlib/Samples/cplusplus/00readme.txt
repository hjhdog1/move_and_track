CANLIB Sample Program 
=====================
Canlib_class.cpp and canlib_class.h represent the canlib in a object oriented way. 

Open the file test.dsw in Visual Studio 6.0 and press F7 to build a simple program that sends 100 can messages. 

The program is just intended as an example of how to use CANLIB. It's not
performance optimized in any way. It may, or may not, be useful
for you.

The program is written in C++ and has been tested with Microsoft compilers.
